# Moved

Development has moved to the [SpeakEasy-2 organization](https://github.com/orgs/SpeakEasy-2/repositories) in order to split the project into multiple repositories.

The MATLAB toolbox and python packages are now available. The toolbox is on the [MATLAB file exchange](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/161231-speakeasy2#add-tags-span) and can be downloaded directly from MATLAB's add-on manager. The python package is on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/speakeasy2/) and can be installed using pip:

``` shell
pip install --user speakeasy2
```

R packages are coming soon.
