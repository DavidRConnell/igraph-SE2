# Moved

Development has moved to the [SpeakEasy-2 organization](https://github.com/orgs/SpeakEasy-2/repositories) in order to split the project into multiple repositories.

The MATLAB toolbox is now available on the [MATLAB file exchange](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/161231-speakeasy2#add-tags-span) and can be downloaded directly from MATLAB's add-on manager.

Python and R packages are coming soon.
